We have done multiple bonus nlp extraction

First we observed the top 3 loved actors, we do so by reviewing what sentiments poeple had regarding all the actors. This helps tell which actors were most loved by the audience.

To this we also have the most hated actors in the award ceremony according to the audence, the actors with most hatred sentiment were extracted. This gives a perspective about the actors and can be fueled by yheir dress/speech etc.

We also have a very interesting field called the most humiliated actor due to another person, in this case we found taylor swift had a very bad reaction when adele won the award

we also got who cracked the funniest jokes, further exploration also shows that there are links to the jokes as well

another cool thing that we observed were, which parties were the most talked about, we found that democratic party, republican as well as after party is discussed, we did more nlp analysis on it as can be seen in the bonus

lastly we also covered who gave the most controversial speech, this was again done through semantic analysis
